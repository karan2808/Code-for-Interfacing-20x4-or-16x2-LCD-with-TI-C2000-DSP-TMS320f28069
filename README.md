# Code-for-Interfacing-20x4-or-16x2-LCD-with-TI-C2000-DSP-TMS320f28069
This project contains a library and an example for interfacing a 16x2 or 20x4 LCD module to a Texas Instruments C2000 DSP TMS320F28069.
It can also be used with other C2000 DSPs by simply changing include files and required registers.
